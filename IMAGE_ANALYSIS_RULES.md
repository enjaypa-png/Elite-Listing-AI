# Image Analysis Rules & Optimization Framework

## Overview
Elite Listing AI uses a comprehensive, rule-based image analysis system that goes far beyond basic quality checks. Our Weighted Image Optimization Index provides sellers with professional-grade feedback that directly impacts Etsy search ranking and conversion rates.

---

## 1. Technical Compliance Rules (40% of Score)

### Resolution Requirements
- **Etsy**: Minimum 2000px on longest side (zoom quality standard)
- **Shopify**: Minimum 2048px on longest side
- **eBay**: Minimum 1600px on longest side
- **Why**: Higher resolution = better zoom experience = higher conversion rates
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Increase resolution to at least 2000px for optimal Etsy zoom quality"

### Aspect Ratio Enforcement
- **Preferred**: 1:1 (square) for uniform product grid visibility
- **Acceptable**: 5:4 for certain product categories
- **Why**: Square images display consistently across all devices and grid layouts
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Crop to 1:1 aspect ratio for better grid visibility"

### File Type & Compression
- **Preferred**: JPEG (80-95% quality)
- **Acceptable**: PNG (only if transparency required)
- **Compression threshold**: Max 80% quality loss
- **Target load speed**: <2 seconds
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Convert to JPEG and compress to 85% quality for faster loading"

### Brightness & Contrast
- **Minimum clarity threshold**: 0.85 luminance index
- **Optimal range**: 0.85-0.95 luminance
- **Why**: Proper brightness ensures product details are visible
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Increase brightness by 15% to improve product visibility"

### Background Cleanliness
- **Required**: Clean, neutral, non-cluttered background
- **Detect**: Distracting elements, busy patterns, competing objects
- **Why**: Clean backgrounds keep focus on the product
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Remove background clutter or use solid white/neutral backdrop"

---

## 2. Etsy Algorithm Optimization Rules (30% of Score)

### Dominant Object Detection
- **Requirement**: Product must occupy ≥70% of image area
- **Why**: Etsy's algorithm favors images where the product is clearly the focus
- **Detection method**: AI-powered object segmentation
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Crop tighter - product should fill 70-80% of frame"

### Color Balance
- **Rule**: Avoid oversaturation; favor natural hues for product realism
- **Optimal saturation**: 60-80% (not oversaturated)
- **Why**: Natural colors = accurate product representation = fewer returns
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Reduce color saturation by 20% for more natural appearance"

### Repetition Check
- **Rule**: Identify duplicate images within the same listing
- **Why**: Etsy penalizes redundancy and rewards variety
- **Implementation**: Phase 2 - Image hash comparison
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Replace duplicate image #3 with different angle or detail shot"

### First Image Prioritization
- **Rule**: First image must have centered composition and strong visual impact
- **Why**: First image determines clickthrough rate (CTR)
- **Checks**: Centering, contrast, brightness, product dominance
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Use this as your 2nd image; choose a more centered shot for #1"

### CTR Estimation Rule
- **Formula**: Predict CTR based on contrast + symmetry + brightness + product dominance
- **Implementation**: Phase 2 - Machine learning model
- **Output**: "Estimated CTR: 3.2% (above average for your category)"

---

## 3. SEO Integration Rules (20% of Score)

### Alt Text Validation (Phase 2)
- **Rule**: Auto-generate keyword-optimized alt text using product title and category
- **Format**: "[Primary Keyword] - [Product Type] - [Key Feature]"
- **Example**: "Handmade Soy Candle - Lavender Scent - Natural Wax"
- **Why**: Alt text improves accessibility and SEO

### File Name Rule (Phase 2)
- **Requirement**: Must include main keyword
- **Format**: "primary-keyword-secondary-keyword.jpg"
- **Example**: "handmade-soy-candle-lavender.jpg"
- **Why**: File names contribute to image SEO ranking

### Metadata Alignment (Phase 2)
- **Rule**: Cross-check embedded EXIF tags for keyword consistency
- **Check**: Title, description, tags match EXIF metadata
- **Why**: Consistent metadata signals quality to search algorithms

---

## 4. Conversion Optimization Rules (10% of Score)

### Emotional Triggers
- **Detect**: Presence of "human use context" (hands, lifestyle backgrounds)
- **Why**: Lifestyle shots increase emotional connection and conversion
- **Auto-suggestion**: "Add a lifestyle image showing product in use"

### Color Psychology
- **Rule**: Match dominant colors to category trends
- **Examples**:
  - Pastels for baby products
  - Earth tones for natural/organic products
  - Bold colors for fashion/accessories
- **Implementation**: Phase 2 - Category-specific color analysis

### Brand Consistency (Phase 2)
- **Rule**: Compare image tone/style against seller's brand pattern dataset
- **Why**: Consistent branding builds trust and recognition
- **Auto-suggestion**: "This image style doesn't match your brand aesthetic"

### Social Proof Cue (Phase 2)
- **Rule**: Encourage overlay for "bestseller" or "5-star rated" badges
- **Compliance**: Must follow Etsy's visual policy
- **Why**: Social proof increases conversion rates
