## üí° NOTES FOR FUTURE MANUS AGENTS

### How to Continue Development:

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone enjaypa-png/Elite-Listing-AI
   cd Elite-Listing-AI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment:**
   - Get OpenAI API key from user
   - Create `.env.local` file
   - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`

4. **Run dev server:**
   ```bash
   # Must override system OPENAI_API_KEY
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<user_key> pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Test the app:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/test
   - Fill in listing details
   - Click "Optimize Listing"
   - Should see 3 AI-generated variants

### Important Technical Details:

- **API Route:** `/app/api/optimize/route.ts`
- **Frontend:** `/app/test/page.tsx`
- **Model:** GPT-4o (fast, high quality)
- **Cost:** ~$0.02 per request
- **Database:** Prisma configured but not deployed (save logic commented out)
- **System API Key:** There's a system-level `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var that must be overridden

### Known Issues:

1. **Database not set up** - Prisma client needs migration
   - Solution: Deploy PostgreSQL and run `npx prisma migrate dev`
   - For now: Database save logic is commented out

2. **System environment variable** - Sandbox has old OpenAI key
   - Solution: Always start dev server with explicit env var override
   - Command: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<user_key> pnpm dev`

3. **No authentication** - Anyone can use the app
   - Solution: Implement auth in Phase 1

### Next Feature to Build:

**Image Analysis** is the next priority. Here's how:

1. Update `/app/api/analyze-image/route.ts` (or create it)
2. Use OpenAI Vision API (`gpt-4o` supports images)
3. Accept image URL or upload
4. Analyze: composition, lighting, clarity, background
5. Return scores (0-100) and specific suggestions
6. Update frontend to display results

Example API call:
```typescript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: [
        { type: "text", text: "Analyze this product image for Etsy..." },
        { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: imageUrl } }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```
