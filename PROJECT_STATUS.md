---

**Status Summary:** Project is 15% complete. UI design is finished and looks great (Apple-style, clean). Documentation is comprehensive and reorganized for high-value MVP. Now need to build actual functionality - starting with OpenAI API integration, then building features in priority order (high-value first, not easy first). User wants comprehensive features that beat all competitors and justify $29/month pricing from day one.

**Next Action:** Push documentation to GitHub, then start OpenAI API integration.
